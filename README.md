# Bank-Customers-Churn Analysis
## Data Analysis Project
### Prepared by: Diaa Aldein Alsayed Ibrahim Osman
### Prepared for: EPSILON AI Institute

In this project, we aim to analyze a dataset containing information about customers who have withdrawn their accounts from the bank due to various reasons, such as losses and other issues. The dataset consists of over 10,000 rows and contains 14 features, each providing valuable information about the customers. We obtained this dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santoshd3/bank-customers) and made some modifications and data cleaning to tailor it to the specific criteria of this project.

## Dataset Features:

1. RowNumber: A sequential number assigned to each row in the dataset.
2. CustomerId: An identity number unique to each customer.
3. Surname: The last name of the customer.
4. CreditScore: The credit score of the customer, providing an indication of their creditworthiness.
5. Geography: The country or region the customer belongs to.
6. Gender: The gender of the customer, categorized as Male or Female.
7. Age: The age of the customer, giving insights into their life stage.
8. Tenure: The number of years for which the customer has been associated with the bank, indicating their loyalty.
9. Balance: The amount of money held in the customer's account.
10. NumOfProducts: The number of bank products utilized by the customer, showing their level of engagement with the bank's offerings.
11. HasCrCard: A binary flag indicating whether the customer holds a credit card with the bank.
12. IsActiveMember: A binary flag indicating the customer's active participation in different bank programs, bonds, insurance, etc.
13. EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer in dollars.
14. Exited: A binary flag (1 or 0) representing whether the customer closed their account with the bank (1) or is retained (0).

## Project Objective:
The main goal of this analysis is to explore the relationship between each feature and customer churn. By examining these associations, we can identify which feature levels exhibit a higher churn rate and gain valuable insights into the factors influencing customer churn. Understanding these factors can help the bank take proactive measures to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

Throughout the analysis, we will delve into various features, such as CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, and EstimatedSalary, and examine their impact on customer churn. By uncovering the key drivers of churn, the bank can devise effective strategies to minimize customer attrition and foster long-term relationships with its clients.
